# Creazione chiavi ssh

In this exercise, we will create an SSH key to connect to a remote server, in this case the Rocky Linux machine already used as an Apache server in https://github.com/AndreaVomero99/formazione_sour/blob/main/apache.md

## First step

The command to create the key is the following:

#### ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa

You will be prompted to enter a password, and then the system will generate the key.

The -b option specifies the number of bits to use for the key, and the -t option specifies the type of key, which in this case is RSA.

We can then verify that the key has been generated by looking for it in the following path (which is usually the default):

#### ls -la /home/user/.ssh/

With the above command, we will display the contents of the .ssh folder. If everything went well, we should find the files id_rsa and id_rsa.pub. The latter is the public key.

## Second step

At this point, we can copy the ssh key to the Rocky Linux machine, specifying the path to the PUBLIC key on the current machine:

#### ssh-copy-id -i /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub utente_rocky@ip_rocky

You will need to enter the password you specified earlier when creating the key. If we have proceeded correctly, the Rocky machine will now have the public key we generated.

## Last step

Now we can connect using the ssh command:

#### ssh rocky_user@ip_rocky

We will be connected to the remote utente_rocky.
