## Ping pong exercise

In this folder you will find several files containing the necessary configuration to set up a "ping pong" of sort between two VM's brought to life with Vagrant

### Required packages

To ensure everything runs smoothly as we would like it to, we are going to need several packages:

`Vagrant` - Will enable us to quickstart our two required VM's


`Ansible` - Will automate the whole process by the usage of its playbook


`sshpass` - Will allow us to circumvent some issues that may arise with ssh key authentication
